## Nukebot recreation in Python

This code is very old, and honestly not very great. Made mostly to learn slash commands & buttons in discord.py
Feel free to use this in whatever you'd like, or to help you learn as I did
Again, don't expect too much from this as it was made in around an hour

The main purpose of this was to be a recreation of nukebot, because as when initially making this bot,
the actual nukebot was down for a while, so while bored one day I decided to recreate it for a friend's server
credits to the original nukebot creators for the original bot and the "inspiration" (if you can call it that)

### How to use:
1. Open config.json, and change token to your bot's token.
2. In config.json, change botowner to your discord id.
3. [Optional] Go to https://apyhub.com, and make an account.
Then, find your API key, and put it in apytoken in config.json.
4. In config.json, change supportserver to the invite to your support server, or leave blank for none.
5. If you don't already have python, get it at https://python.org
6. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
7. Run main.py
